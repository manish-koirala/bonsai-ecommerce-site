# Ecommerce Site - Front End Project
This is a web development project utilizing only front-end technologies like html, css and javascript. It was my first year group coursework for the module "Introduction To Information Systems". In this project, my major contribution was on the products page, feedback form as well as the login and register portal pages.

**NOTE**: For privacy sake, I have removed a bit of content that existed in the original project.
