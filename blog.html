                <p> Technology would be an body of knowledge for which would devoted to creating tools, processing actions and extracting of materials. The term ‘Technology” is wide and everyone has their own way of understanding the meaning of technology.
                    We use technology to accomplish various tasks in our daily lives and We can describe technology as products, processes or organizations. We use technology to extend in our abilities.Technology is the application of knowledge to reach
                    practical goals in a specifiable and reproducible way. The word technology may also mean the product of such an endeavor. The use of technology is widely prevalent in medicine, science, industry, communication, transportation, and
                    daily life. Technologies include physical objects like utensils or machines and intangible tools such as software. Many technological advancements have led to societal changes. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used
                    in the prehistoric era,followed by fire use, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language in the Ice Age.The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age enabled wider travel and the creation of more
                    complex machines.Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet have lowered communication barriers and ushered in the knowledge economy. While technology contributes to economic development
                    and human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or cause social harms like technological unemployment caused by automation. As a result, philosophical and political debates have arisen
                    over the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and the mitigation of technology's potential downsides.Historical and contemporary movements like neo-Luddism and anarcho-primitivism criticize technology's pervasiveness,
                    while adherents to transhumanism and techno-progressivism actively support technological change, viewing it as emancipatory. Many negative impacts of technology can be mitigated through technological innovations like renewable energy
                    in transportation and industry, genetically modified crops to address soil depletion,and space exploration to mitigate global catastrophic risks.</p>

                <h1>Positive Impact Of Technology</h1>
                <br>
                <img src="images/blog/IMportance.jpg" alt="positive impact" height="300px">
                <br>
                <p>We live in a capitalist society, which means that a lot of the new advancements that are made in technology are made by businesses looking to improve their products/services or to improve their ability to market their products/services.
                    New tech has also emerged over the years with the purpose of making business operations more efficient and effective as well.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>1. Improving Strategies</h2>
                <p>Business strategies have evolved and improved greatly as a result of technology. One of the most basic elements of running a business -- the hiring process -- has been drastically improved by technology. It wasn’t that long ago that businesses
                    were extremely limited when it came to hiring new employees. You would have to run ads in the paper or reach out to hiring agencies for help. Even then, the vast majority of your hires would be local. These days, the hiring pool has
                    expanded greatly as a result of online job posting sites, such as Monster, and social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, that can connect employers with high quality job candidates all over the world. The hiring process isn’t the only
                    business strategy affected in a positive way by technology. Advancements in statistics, communication, and trade have all been made through new technology as well.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>2. Accurate Statistics</h2>
                <p>Statistics were once extremely limited. Companies would only get access to reports on a monthly basis, making it difficult to make highly informed business decisions. With the use of automated software tools, executives can collect and
                    analyze data in real time that can be displayed and sent out as reports whenever needed. Because everything is digital, you can also provide your organization with access to dashboards that have the most important metrics displayed
                    instead of having to hold meetings during which you spend time putting up boards or showing slides with outdated statistics. Essentially, technology has made it easier to collect and analyze massive amounts of data to help improve
                    your decision making while also making it easy to share reports throughout your organization at any point.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>3. Easier Communication</h2>
                <p>These days, there are software solutions that help automate scheduling. Communication platforms also allow employees to speak with one another through email or chat that can be accessed on multiple devices whether they’re in the office
                    or not. Essentially, everyone is connected, thereby making it easy to communicate with anyone across your organization as well as with clients and prospects.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>4. New Techniques Of Promoting Business</h2>
                <p>In addition to improving business strategy, technology has also made marketing easier, more effective, and more cost-efficient. In the days before the Internet, companies were limited to running ads in newspapers and magazines. If they
                    had the budget, they could run ads on TV or radio as well. As the Internet grew and social media platforms began popping up everywhere, marketing became much easier, especially for smaller businesses and startups with limited advertising
                    budgets. Not only is it more affordable to market your company online, but it’s easier to find your target audience, identify what their needs are, and engage with them on a personal level. There are far more options when it comes
                    to online marketing as well -- and you can track the performance of your online marketing strategies using analytics tools to see what’s working and what isn’t -- and make adjustments on the fly.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>5. Increase In Income Generation</h2>
                <p>As a direct result of being able to advertise more effectively and more efficiently, income generation has increased drastically. Startups have an easier time getting off the ground because they don’t need to invest as many resources into
                    trying to increase brand exposure using traditional methods when they can advertise online instead. Additionally, marketing automation solutions have made it possible to eliminate the need for doing many repetitive, time-consuming
                    tasks by hand, reducing staff needs. Many of the technologies that have come out over the past decade and that continue to come out have made the day-to-day operations of a business more efficient, thereby reducing overhead costs and
                    increasing productivity, both of which help to improve profits.</p>

                <h1>Negetive Impact Of Technology</h1>
                <br>
                <img src="images/blog/negetive.jpg" alt="Negetive impact" height="300px">
                <br>
                <p>We live in world where the technology is very important. We often witness the excitement generated by the access to new technologies. But we also see the negetive impacts of technology, especially with kids.In a world of instant gratification
                    and continual distractions, technology has the ability to make users easily distracted, impatient and continually bored. Technology can also make users forget important information, communicate in shorthand, and be incapable of deep
                    thinking.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>1. Depression and Other Mental Health Issues</h2>
                <p>The authors of a 2016 systematic reviewTrusted Source discussed the link between social networks and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive interactions and
                    social support on these platforms appeared to have lower levels of depression and anxiety. However, the reverse was also true. People who perceived that they had more negative social interactions online and who were more prone to social
                    comparison experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety. So, while there does appear to be a link between social media and mental health, a significant determining factor is the types of interactions people feel they are having
                    on these platforms.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>2. Sleep problems</h2>
                <p>Using technology too close to bedtime may cause issues with sleep. This effect has to do with the fact that blue light, such as the light from cell phones, e-readers, and computers, stimulates the brain. Authors of a 2014 study found that
                    this blue light is enough to disturb the body’s natural circadian rhythm. This disturbance could make it harder to fall asleep or lead to a person feeling less alert the next day. To avoid the potential impact of blue light on the
                    brain, people can stop using electronic devices that emit blue light in the hour or two before bedtime. Gentle activities to wind down with instead, such as reading a book, doing gentle stretches, or taking a bath, are alternatives.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>3. Reduced physical activity</h2>
                <p>Most everyday digital technologies are sedentary. More extended use of these technologies promotes a more sedentary lifestyle, which is known to have negative health effects, such as contributing to: obesity cardiovascular disease type
                    2 diabetes premature death Finding ways to take breaks from sedentary technologies may help promote a more active lifestyle. Other forms of technology may help, however. Research from 2017Trusted Source indicates that active technologies,
                    such as app notifications, emails, and wearable technologies that promote exercise may reduce short-term sedentary behavior. This could help people set healthful patterns and become more physically active.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>4. Poor Body posture</h2>
                <p>The way many people use mobile devices and computers may also contribute to incorrect posture. Over time, this may lead to musculoskeletal issues. Many technologies promote a “down and forward” user position, meaning the person is hunched
                    forward and looking down at the screen. This can put an unnecessary amount of pressure on the neck and spine.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>5. In children</h2>
                <p>Children’s brains are still developing and may be more sensitive to the effects of technology and its overuse than adult brains. A 2018 review of various studies noted the possible adverse effects of children using different technologies.
                    Children who overuse technology may be more likely to experience issues, including: low academic performance , lack of attention , low creativity , delays in language development , delays in social and emotional development , physical
                    inactivity and obesity , poor sleep quality , social issues, such as social incompatibility and anxiety , aggressive behaviors , addiction to these technologies , higher BMI . The research also noted the importance of teaching children
                    to interact with these technologies in healthful ways by monitoring their time using them and providing interesting alternatives.</p>
